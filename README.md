# 🚨 VitaLine – Secure Video Conferencing for Medical Emergencies

**VitaLine** is a **prototype web application** developed as part of the **Digital Health university course project**.
Its goal is to demonstrate how secure, real-time video communication can assist **emergency medical response** by enabling rapid visual assessment, triage, and coordination between patients and healthcare professionals **before on-site intervention**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The project explores how video conferencing, geolocation, and live data input (vitals, triage level, connection quality) can improve emergency evaluation and reduce response time.
This is an **academic prototype**, built **for demonstration and research purposes only**, not for real-world medical use.

## ⚙️ Key Features

* Real-time **video conferencing** between patient and healthcare provider
* **Triage and vitals input panel** for quick on-screen assessment
* **Emergency escalation controls** (dispatch, specialist alert, documentation)
* **Secure connection status and end-to-end encryption** indicators
* **Interactive UI** built with **Tailwind CSS, ECharts, and Anime.js**

## 🧠 Academic Context

This prototype was designed within the **Digital Health course (2025)** to combine:

* Technical development (web interface, real-time systems)
* Field research (interviews and surveys with healthcare professionals and users)
* Ethical reflection on the digitalization of emergency response

The project includes original user data collection and expert interviews to assess the **feasibility, usability, and ethical implications** of real-time remote medical triage.
