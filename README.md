# VitaLine
VitaLine is a prototype video conferencing application developed for the Digital Health course project. The idea is to offer a simple and quick tool enabling instant connection between a patient and a healthcare professional in an emergency situation, in order to carry out the pre-hospital triage before the arrival of emergency services.
